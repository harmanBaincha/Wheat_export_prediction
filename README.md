# Wheat_export_prediction
New DG Food Agro are a multinational exporter of various grains from India since nearly 130 years. But their main product of exporting since early 1980s has been Wheat. They export wheat to countries like America, Afghanistan, Australia etc. They started seeing varying exports of sales year on year for various countries. The reason that was theorized by them had a lot of natural causes like floods, country growth, population explosion etc.Now they need to decide which countries fall in the same range of export and which donâ€™t. They also need to know which countries export is low and can be improved and which countries are performing very well across the years.
